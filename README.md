These notebooks complement the working paper [Differential Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02347) by Brian Huge and [Antoine Savine](https://antoinesavine.com) (2020), including code, practical implementation considerations and extensions. 

**DifferentialML.ipynb** is the main demonstration notebook for the concepts and ideas of the working paper. We provide a simple, yet fully functional implementation of twin networks and differential training, and apply them to some textbook examples, including the reproduction of the Bachelier example in the section 3.1 of the article. We also discuss the details of a practical implementation, including the important matters of initialization, optimization and normalization, which are not covered in the paper. This notebook is based on TensorFlow 1.x and built to run on GPU, either locally or on Google Colab.

**DifferentialMLTF2.ipynb** is an upgrade to DifferentialML.ipynb for TensorFlow 2.x. Its current form does not run 'idiomatic' TensorFLow 2 code, what we do is really run TensorFlow 1 code in TensorFlow 2. Still, the new notebook benefits from the latest TensorFlow improvements resulting in a noticeable performance improvement. DifferentialML.ipynb will no longer be maintained going forward, bug fixes, improvements and extensions will be implemented directly in the TensorFlow 2 notebook.

**DifferentialRegression.ipynb** applies differential learning in the context of classic regression models. In the article, we applied differential learning to deep neural networks only. This notebook applies it to polynomial regression to the basket option in a correlated Bachelier model of section 3,1. We see that, with regression too, differential training provides a massive performance improvement, without the need for additional regularization, or hyperparameter optimization.

We also posted additional material [here](https://differential-machine-learning.github.io/appendices/), including mathematical proofs, various extensions and considerations for an implementation in production.
